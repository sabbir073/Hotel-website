I have a Hotel in Croatia, Where I provide Hotels room of various type.

You have to create a beautiful stunning Croatia Based Hothel booking website with possible all features. it will be a two language website, english and croatian.
We need multi pages Home, about, Rooms, Careeer, Contact pages.

I want to get the website in next js 15.4 with tailwind and typescript. We will host the website in Cpanel, so we will use Mysql as database.
you have to create database structure for Admin login, Admin Dashboard needed for 3 things.

1. room booking Order
2. Contact page ssubmission
3. Career apply submission

As we are taking international booking, so passport number wwill be mandatory field for all 3 submisssion.

The whole website should be static for now. Later we will make it database driven one by one.

Hope you understand what to do now.

I have the logo file in the folder and the contact of my hotel is +385924512500  and Address:   Matošića ul. 21000, Split, Croatia
